Collaborence is a site where students can read their class materials in a collaborative community. Students can follow the courses that they are currently taking, and as they read the slides, ask questions while referring to specific lecture slides. Others can then read the their comments/questions and even reply to them! Collaborence is changing the way people collaborate and learn!
